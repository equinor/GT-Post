[template]
value = Roda

[simstoptime]
name = Simulation time
value = 320.5
description = This is the total hydrodynamic simulation time of a model run.

[outputinterval]
name = Output interval
value = 1
description = This is the output interval used for the map output (2D and 3D), observation point output and the profile output.

[basinslope]
name = Basin slope
value = 0.04
description = This is the bed level slope between the coastline and the offshore model boundary.

[riverdischargeini]
name = Initial river discharge per channel
value = 1000
description = This is the initial river discharge per channel (one channel in the case of Gule Horn, Neslen, Roda X; four channels in the case of Sobrarbe). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the final river discharge, a constant discharge is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying river discharge is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final river discharges.

[riverdischargefin]
name = Final river discharge per channel
value = 1000
description = This is the final river discharge per channel (one channel in the case of Gule Horn, Neslen, Roda X; four channels in the case of Sobrarbe). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the initial river discharge, a constant discharge is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying river discharge is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final river discharges.

[tidalamplitude]
name = Tidal amplitude
value = 3
description = This is the tidal amplitude at the offshore model boundary.

[waveheightini]
name = Initial significant wave height
value = 1
description = This is the initial significant wave height applied to the model. If this value coincides with the value chosen for the final significant wave height, a constant wave height is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying wave height is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final wave heights.

[wavedirection]
name = Mean wave direction
value = 0
description = This is the mean wave direction according to the nautical convention (0 degrees = waves from the North/orthogonal to the coast)

[waveheightfin]
name = Final significant wave height
value = 1
description = This is the final significant wave height applied to the model. If this value coincides with the value chosen for the initial significant wave height, a constant wave height is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying wave height is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final wave heights.

[subsidenceland]
name = Subsidence at landward model boundary
value = 5
description = This is the amount by which the bed level at the landward model boundary will be subsided by the end of the simulation (constant subsidence rate between 0 m and the chosen value). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the seaward model boundary, a uniform subsidence for the whole model domain is applied. If the values differ, a spatially varying subsidence is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the landward and the seaward model boundaries.

[subsidencesea]
name = Subsidence at seaward model boundary
value = 10
description = This is the amount by which the bed level at the seaward model boundary will be subsided by the end of the simulation (constant subsidence rate between 0 m and the chosen value). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the landward model boundary, a uniform subsidence for the whole model domain is applied. If the values differ, a spatially varying subsidence is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the landward and the seaward model boundaries.

[composition]
name = Sediment classes
value = coarse-sand
description = Read <a href='/static/images/sediment-types.png' target='_blank'>more</a> about the sediment composition classes.
