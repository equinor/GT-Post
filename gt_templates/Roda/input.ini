[template]
value = Roda

[simstoptime]
name = Simulation time
value = 320.5
description = This is the total hydrodynamic simulation time of a model run.

[outputinterval]
name = Output interval
value = 1
description = This is the output interval used for the map output (2D and 3D), observation point output and the profile output.

[basinslope]
name = Basin slope
value = 0.1
description = This is the bed level slope between the coastline and the offshore model boundary.

[riverwidth]
name = River width
value = 500
description = This is the width of the river excluding the floodplains (not availalbe for the Sobrarbe template).

[riverlength]
name = River length
value = 100
description = This is the number of cells between the landward model boundary and the coastline. This parameter is only for the use of the preprocessing scripts but is not editable.

[riverdischargeini]
name = Initial river discharge per channel
value = 1000
description = This is the initial river discharge per channel (one channel in the case of River dominated delta, Gule Horn/Neslen and Roda; four channels in the case of Sobrarbe). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the final river discharge, a constant discharge is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying river discharge is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final river discharges.

[riverdischargefin]
name = Final river discharge per channel
value = 250
description = This is the final river discharge per channel (one channel in the case of River dominated delta, Gule Horn/Neslen and Roda; four channels in the case of Sobrarbe). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the initial river discharge, a constant discharge is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying river discharge is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final river discharges.

[tidalamplitude]
name = Tidal amplitude
value = 2
description = This is the tidal amplitude at the offshore model boundary.

[waveheightini]
name = Initial significant wave height
value = 0.11
description = This is the initial significant wave height applied to the model. If this value coincides with the value chosen for the final significant wave height, a constant wave height is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying wave height is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final wave heights.

[waveheightfin]
name = Final significant wave height
value = 0.3
description = This is the final significant wave height applied to the model. If this value coincides with the value chosen for the initial significant wave height, a constant wave height is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying wave height is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final wave heights.

[wavedirection]
name = Mean wave direction
value = 0
description = This is the mean wave direction according to the nautical convention (0 degrees = waves from the North/orthogonal to the coast)

[subsidenceland]
name = Subsidence between landward model boundary and coastline
value = 0
description = This is the amount by which the bed level between the landward model boundary and the coastline will be subsided by the end of the simulation (constant subsidence rate between 0 m and the chosen value). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the seaward model boundary, a uniform subsidence for the whole model domain is applied. If the values differ, a spatially varying subsidence is applied based on a linear interpolation between both values.

[subsidencesea]
name = Subsidence at seaward model boundary
value = 12
description = This is the amount by which the bed level at the seaward model boundary will be subsided by the end of the simulation (constant subsidence rate between 0 m and the chosen value). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the area between the landward model boundary and the coastline, a uniform subsidence for the whole model domain is applied. If the values differ, a spatially varying subsidence is applied based on a linear interpolation between both values.

[composition]
name = Sediment classes
value = coarse-sand
description = This is the grain size distribution (vol-%) of the fluvial sediment input and the initial bed composition. Coarse sand: 10% vc, 10% c, 15% m, 35% f, 20% vf, 10% mud; Medium sand: 5% vc, 5% c, 10% m, 35% f, 35% vf, 10% mud; Fine sand: 2% vc, 3% c, 5% m, 30% f, 45% vf, 15% mud; Very fine sand: 2% vc, 3% c, 5% m, 25% f, 35% vf, 30% mud; Coarse silt: 5% c, 5% m, 25% f, 35% vf, 15% mud A, 15% mud B
