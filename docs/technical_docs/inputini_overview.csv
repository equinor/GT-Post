template|Name of the template to serve as a basis for setting up the model.
simstoptime|Total hydrodynamic simulation time of a model run in hydrodynamic days.
outputinterval|Output interval used for the map output (2D and 3D), observation point output and the profile output.
basinslope|Bed level slope between the coastline and the offshore model boundary in degrees.
channelwidth|Width of the river channel in meters excluding the floodplains (not available for the Roda and Sobrarbe templates).
riverlength|Number of cells between the landward model boundary and the coastline. This parameter is only for the use of the preprocessing scripts but is not editable in the GUI.
riverdischargeini|Initial river discharge per channel in qubic meters per second (one channel in the case of River dominated delta, Gule Horn/Neslen and Roda; four channels in the case of Sobrarbe). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the final river discharge, a constant discharge is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying river discharge is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final river discharges.
riverdischargefin|Final river discharge per channel in qubic meters per second  (one channel in the case of River dominated delta, Gule Horn/Neslen and Roda; four channels in the case of Sobrarbe). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the initial river discharge, a constant discharge is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying river discharge is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final river discharges.
tidalamplitude|Tidal amplitude at the offshore model boundary in meters.
waveheightini|Initial significant wave height in meters applied to the model. If this value coincides with the value chosen for the final significant wave height, a constant wave height is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying wave height is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final wave heights.
waveheightfin|Final significant wave height in meters applied to the model. If this value coincides with the value chosen for the initial significant wave height, a constant wave height is applied during the entire simulation. If the values differ, a time varying wave height is applied based on a linear interpolation between the values for the initial and the final wave heights.
wavedirection|Mean wave direction according to the nautical convention (0 degrees = waves from the North/orthogonal to the coast)
subsidenceland|Amount by which the bed level between the landward model boundary and the coastline will be subsided by the end of the simulation in meters (constant subsidence rate between 0 m and the chosen value). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the seaward model boundary, a uniform subsidence for the whole model domain is applied. If the values differ, a spatially varying subsidence is applied based on a linear interpolation between both values.
sudsidencesea|Amount by which the bed level at the seaward model boundary will be subsided by the end of the simulation in meters (constant subsidence rate between 0 m and the chosen value). If this value coincides with the value chosen for the area between the landward model boundary and the coastline, a uniform subsidence for the whole model domain is applied. If the values differ, a spatially varying subsidence is applied based on a linear interpolation between both values.
composition|Grain size distribution (vol-%) of the fluvial sediment input and the initial bed composition. Coarse sand: 10% vc, 10% c, 15% m, 35% f, 20% vf, 10% mud; Medium sand: 5% vc, 5% c, 10% m, 35% f, 35% vf, 10% mud; Fine sand: 2% vc, 3% c, 5% m, 30% f, 45% vf, 15% mud; Very fine sand: 2% vc, 3% c, 5% m, 25% f, 35% vf, 30% mud; Coarse silt: 5% c, 5% m, 25% f, 35% vf, 15% mud A, 15% mud B/
